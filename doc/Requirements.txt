Purpose:
========

Aim of the software is to allow users to review image files. These files may be freshly imported from a digital camera.
The definition of a review consists of one or more directories which contain the image files (configuration is called
review set).
When a review is started, the user is guided through the set of images and may decide whether the file is accepted,
deleted directly or marked for later deletion. Deletion can bei either a hard delete or moving a file to an archive
directory. A review may be committed, which means that the deletion of marked files will be carried out.
When the software is restarted, it will automatically search for new files in the directories of the active review set.
This will also be done, if the review has been committed in a previous session.
